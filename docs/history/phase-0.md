## Production deployment (2026-08-15)

Target: `personal-os` — Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, HP EliteDesk 800 G5, Intel i5-9500T, 30GB RAM, reachable via `ssh personal-os` (key auth), on the same tailnet as this Mac.

**What was done:**
1. Docker Engine 29.7.2 + Compose plugin v5.4.0 installed via Docker's official apt repo (user ran the install commands interactively — sudo requires a password this session can't supply). `himallinux` added to the `docker` group (user-approved, explained as root-equivalent access first) and set as the Tailscale operator, both verified working passwordlessly afterward.
2. Repo transferred via `rsync` over the existing SSH connection (not git — no GitHub remote was created, per instruction). Excluded `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`, build caches, and `apps/mobile` (not part of the server-side stack).
3. New `docker-compose.prod.yml`: binds only the API to `127.0.0.1:3000` (needed because `tailscale serve` runs on the host and can't reach the Docker network directly — Postgres remains published nowhere in every case), adds explicit `restart: unless-stopped` and Docker's `local` logging driver (rotation, so container logs can't fill the disk on an always-on box) to all three services.
4. Production `.env` generated fresh directly on the server via `openssl rand -hex 16` — never copied from the Mac's dev `.env`. `chmod 600`.
5. Images built on the server; Postgres brought up; migrations run via ephemeral `docker compose run` containers (never publishing Postgres's port, even temporarily) — Drizzle migration and `pg-boss migrate` both as `posops_migrator`, then `scripts/grant-pgboss-runtime.sql` for `posops_app`'s scoped runtime grants.
6. Full stack brought up with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.
7. `tailscale serve --bg 3000` — the CLI itself surfaced a one-time web-consent URL (Serve wasn't yet enabled for the tailnet); user approved it in-browser, then the command completed and the proxy came up.

**Verification actually run (all 15 items from the deployment plan):**

| # | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Docker Engine works | `docker run hello-world` succeeds |
| 2 | Compose works, base file publishes nothing | `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config` has no `ports:` block anywhere |
| 3 | Postgres healthy, persistent volume, no published port | `docker compose ps` → healthy; `docker volume inspect personal-os_postgres_data` → local driver, real mountpoint; merged prod config shows exactly one published port (`127.0.0.1:3000`, the API) |
| 4 | Migrations ran as `posops_migrator` | `\dt` → `worker_heartbeat` owned by `posops_migrator` |
| 5 | pg-boss schema via migrator | `\dn+` → `pgboss` schema owned by `posops_migrator`, `posops_app` granted `USAGE` only |
| 6 | `posops_app` has no DDL | direct `CREATE TABLE` as `posops_app` → `ERROR: permission denied for schema public` |
| 7 | API `/health` reports real DB connectivity | `{"status":"ok","db":"connected",...}` |
| 8 | Worker independent, heartbeat updates | `worker.lastBeatAt` advances, `stale: false`; worker logs show `pg-boss started` / `worker started, bootstrap.heartbeat scheduled every minute` with no errors |
| 9 | API/worker reach Postgres only over the Docker network | `getent hosts postgres` resolves inside the API container (172.18.0.2); `curl 127.0.0.1:5432` from the host fails to connect (nothing published) |
| 10 | Tailscale Serve HTTPS reachable from the Mac | `curl https://personal-os.tail62a68f.ts.net/health` from the Mac → HTTP 200, `db: "connected"` |
| 11 | No unintended public exposure | `ss -tln` on the server: API only on `127.0.0.1:3000`; Tailscale's HTTPS listener bound to the tailscale interface IP specifically (`100.117.78.19:443` / the `fd7a:...` IPv6), not `0.0.0.0` — unreachable from LAN or the public internet, tailnet peers only |
| 12 | Restart behavior correct | `docker compose stop`/`start`/`restart` on api/worker all recover cleanly, confirmed via `/health` after each. **Full OS reboot test actually performed and verified** (2026-08-15): user ran `sudo reboot` (needs their password, outside this session's reach); post-reboot, `uptime -s` confirmed a fresh boot (`2026-08-15 17:43:42`, ~8 minutes prior); `docker compose ps` showed all three containers `Up`/`Up (healthy)` with **no manual intervention**; local `/health` on the server returned `db: "connected"` with a live worker heartbeat; **`https://personal-os.tail62a68f.ts.net/health` from the Mac over Tailscale returned HTTP 200 with `db: "connected"` and a fresh, non-stale heartbeat** — the full stack, including Tailscale Serve, survives an unattended reboot |
| 13 | Prod config stays separate from dev | `docker-compose.dev.yml` was never referenced in any server-side command this session |
| 14 | Worker/API lifecycle independence | stopped `api` — `worker` and `postgres` stayed `Up`; confirmed by design too (compose file has no `depends_on` between api and worker) |
| 15 | lint/typecheck/tests still pass | `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm --filter @personal-os/core test` — all clean (Mac side, re-run post-deployment) |
